# Homework-3

For this assignmet you will be playing with stacks and queues. 

You should create a module called: **DataStructs.py**. In this module you will have two classes:  

* Stack (containing methods):
  * push
  * pop
  * peek
  * isEmpty
  * isFull(self):
  * Appropriately overwritten len, and str
* Queue (containing methods):
  * insert
  * remove
  * peek
  * isEmpty
  * isFull
  * Appropriately overwritten len, and str

You should also provide the user of this module the function FunnyString(). This function will take a string and then use the Queue and Stack structures you have written in order to return a manipulated version of the string such as if the input to FunnyString() is:

"lraK nac gnis tuoba gnihtyreve dna eht erom eh ...sgnis ehT erom eh sevol skcats dna !seueuq yoJ .emit"

then FunnyString() will return:

"Karl can sing about everything and the more he sings... The more he loves stacks and queues! Joy time."

Your homework should also include an interactive python notebook that showcases you useing your DataStructs.py class by importing it. Testing the Array and the Queue class and then using the FunnyString() function on multiple strings of your choosing.
